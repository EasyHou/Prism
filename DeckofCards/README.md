To create the deck of cards, I decided it would be easiest to treat both cards and decks as objects. The decks would have a list for all cards available to draw as well as a list for cards that have already been drawn. This way, when a deck is shuffled, all 52 cards are accounted for. For the shuffling method, I decided to the shuffle function under the random library as it seemed like the easiest way to shuffle a list. 

The card object was fairly simple as it only needed a number attribute and a suit attribute. For clarity and simplicity, I thought these values would be easiest to keep track of as numbers referencing to indices of the suits and numbers lists. The str and repr functions were extra little touches so that when printed or evaluated, these cards would return something meaningful such as "Ace of Spades" rather than a reference to an object.
